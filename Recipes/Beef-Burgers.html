        <p>Big field mushrooms or slabs of halloumi cheese are a good replacement for beef patties.\
            Ligtly dist them with Royco® Savoury Mince Dry Cook-In Sauce before you fry them in ot oil.
        </p>
        <h4 class="extras">Family Friendly</h4>
        <p>Leave the mustard out of the cheese sauce if your kids prefer a plainer taste.</p>
        <h4 class="extras">Cook's Tips:</h4>
        <p>To cook the patties in an air-fryer, preheat it to 190 °C. Add the patties in a single layer,
            and cook for 6-7 minutes, or until done to your liking. Flip the patties halfway through the cooking time. <br> <br>
        For juicier burger patties, use ordinary mince with some fat content, not lean mince. </p>

            <h2>Method</h2>
                <p class="method1"><strong class="method-num">1. </strong>Tip the mince into a bowl. Add the contents of the sachet of Royco® Savoury Mince Dry Cook-In Sauce, season to taste with salt and black pepper, and mix very well (hands work best!).</p>
                <p class="method2"><strong class="method-num">2. </strong>Divide the mixture into four and shape into neat patties.</p>
                <p class="method3"><strong class="method-num">3. </strong>Heat the oil in a frying pan or griddle pan and cook the patties over a high heat for 4–5 minutes on each side, or until done to your liking. You can also braai the patties, or air-fry them (see Cook’s notes, below).</p>
                <p class="method4"><strong class="method-num">4. </strong>In the meantime, cut the burger buns in half and lightly toast them, cut side down, in a dry frying pan. If you’re adding battered onion rings, cook them now according to the instructions on the packet and keep hot.</p>
                <p class="method5"><strong class="method-num">5. </strong>Remove the patties from the pan, place on a warm plate and cover loosely with foil to rest for a few minutes while you make the sauce.</p>
                <p class="method6"><strong class="method-num">6. </strong>Empty the contents of the sachet of Royco® Four Cheese Flavour Sauce into a measuring jug. Heat the milk on the stove (or in the microwave). When it’s just below boiling point, pour it into the jug up to the 250ml mark, whisking continuously with a fork. Stir for 1 more minute, or until the sauce is thick and creamy.</p>
                <p class="method7"><strong class="method-num">7. </strong>Immediately add the grated cheese and mustard, and continue mixing until all the cheese has melted.</p>
                <p class="method8"><strong class="method-num">8. </strong>Arrange some fresh rocket on the burger buns and top with cooked onion rings. Place the patties on top, then pour the hot cheese sauce over them.</p>
                <p class="method9"><strong class="method-num">9. </strong>Serve immediately with barbecue sauce or condiments of your choice.</p>
