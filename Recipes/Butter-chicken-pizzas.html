        <h4 class="extras">Vegetarian</h4>
        <p>For a hearty vegetarian version of this dish, replace the beef with brown lentils or soya</p>
        <h4 class="extras">Family Friendly</h4>
        <p>If your kids won’t eat spinach, leave it out, or use frozen peas instead.</p>
        <h4 class="extras">Cook's Tips:</h4>
        <p>The pasta will continue to absorb liquid while the dish bakes, so make sure that sauce is fairly wet. If it looks a little dry, sprinkle a few tablespoons of water over the dish before you top it with cheese.
        You can make this dish well in advance and keep it in the fridge. Let it come to room temperature before you bake it.</p>

            <h2>Method</h2>
                <p class="method1"><strong class="method-num">1. </strong>Heat the oil in a pot and fry the onions over a medium heat until soft and golden (about 5 minutes).</p>
                <p class="method2"><strong class="method-num">2. </strong>Stir in the garlic and tomato paste and cook for 1 more minute.</p>
                <p class="method3"><strong class="method-num">3. </strong>Turn the heat up and add the mince, breaking up any clumps with a fork. Cook, stirring often, for about 5 minutes, or until lightly browned.</p>
                <p class="method4"><strong class="method-num">4. </strong>Tip the tinned tomatoes into the pot. Sprinkle the Royco® Bolognaise Dry Cook-In Sauce powder all over the top, then immediately pour in the water (or stock) and stir very well.</p>
                <p class="method5"><strong class="method-num">5. </strong>Add the mixed herbs and season to taste with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil and cook, uncovered, over a medium heat for 30 minutes, stirring now and then.</p>
                <p class="method6"><strong class="method-num">6. </strong>In the meantime, heat your oven 180 °C and bring plenty of salted water to the boil in a large pot. Add the pasta and cook for the time specified on the packet.</p>
                <p class="method7"><strong class="method-num">7. </strong>When the pasta is almost done, add the baby spinach leaves to the sauce. Cook gently for a further 2 minutes, or until the leaves have wilted but are still bright green. Take the pot off the heat.</p>
                <p class="method8"><strong class="method-num">8. </strong>Drain the pasta in a colander and return it to the pot you boiled it in. Pour in the sauce and gently stir everything together.</p>
                <p class="method9"><strong class="method-num">9. </strong>Tip the mixture into a greased ovenproof dish. Top with the cheese and bake at 180 °C for about 25 minutes, or until the pasta is heated through and the cheese is bubbling.</p>
                <p class="method10"><strong class="method-num">10. </strong>Serve piping hot with a crisp green salad.</p>
